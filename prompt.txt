Create a monorepo project for a multiplayer card game platform using Node.js and TypeScript.

**Goals:**
- Support multiplayer card games based on a standard 52-card deck.
- Users can join a game room using a shared code.
- Each player sees their own hand of cards on their device.
- A shared “table view” shows public game state, intended for a tablet or TV.
- Build this as an MVP with clean scaffolding and simple demo logic.

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend:
  - Node.js
  - TypeScript
  - boardgame.io for game logic and state synchronization
- Frontend:
  - React + TypeScript using Vite
  - boardgame.io/react for client integration
- Real-time communication:
  - WebSockets (use boardgame.io’s built-in support)

**Folder Structure:**
- /client → React + Vite frontend
- /server → Node.js + boardgame.io backend
- /games  → Contains modular game logic

**Functionality to include:**
- A simple demo card game where each player draws one card from a shuffled 52-card deck and the highest card wins.
- boardgame.io Game definition in /games/simple-card-game.ts
- Game server that exposes the game via boardgame.io’s server() function and runs on port 8000
- React client with a `Client` wrapper from boardgame.io/react, hardcoded to player 0 for now
- Instructions in README.md for how to start the server and frontend

**Dev Environment:**
- TypeScript support in both frontend and backend
- Use `ts-node` in the backend
- Vite for fast frontend builds

Deliver working code in the expected folder structure with package.json files where needed.
